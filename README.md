# Quirk Trade Tool

Multi-source vehicle valuation **demo** for Quirk Auto Dealers. The app is organized as a minimal monorepo:

- **frontend/** — Next.js 14 UI (TypeScript, Tailwind, React Hook Form, Zod)
- **orchestrator/** — Express + TypeScript API that:
  - normalizes provider quotes (demo adapters provided)
  - aggregates values (outlier drop + trimmed mean + confidence band)
  - decodes VINs via **NHTSA VPIC** fallback
  - writes an immutable **Appraisal Receipt** (JSON) and can render a PDF on demand.

> **Legal/production note:** This repo ships **demo provider adapters** (BlackBook/KBB/NADA/Manheim/Auction) that simulate results. For production, you must implement licensed provider integrations under `orchestrator/src/adapters/providers/*` and wire them in. Do **not** imply live aggregation until licensed APIs are connected and validated.

## Requirements

- **Node 20+**
- **pnpm** (Corepack recommended)

## Quick start (local dev)

```bash
# install everything
pnpm install

# frontend: point to the API

# run both apps (frontend :3000, API :4000)
pnpm dev

## 📚 API Documentation

- [Full API Reference](./docs/API.md) - Complete endpoint documentation
- [Postman Collection](./postman/Quirk-Trade-Tool-API.postman_collection.json) - Import and test
- [Mock Server](https://f554d68c-70e5-4bb3-a9a3-0344f9638408.mock.pstmn.io) - Test without backend

## Multi-store support
- Frontend shows a Dealership dropdown sourced from `frontend/app/lib/dealerships.ts`.
- Orchestrator validates `storeId` against `src/config/dealerships.json` and stamps it on the receipt (JSON + PDF).
- To add or rename stores, edit both files and redeploy (no code changes required).
