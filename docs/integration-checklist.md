3. **Pricing section appears** showing:
   - Average market price
   - Wholesale estimate (15% markup)
   - Trade-in value (20% markup)
   - Comparable listings table
   - Price range analysis

## ✨ Key Features

- **Auto-triggers on VIN decode** - No extra button clicks needed
- **Real market data** - Uses auto.dev listings API
- **Mileage-based adjustments** - Price adjusted by $0.10 per mile
- **Multiple estimates** - Shows both wholesale and trade-in values
- **Comparable listings** - View 10+ similar vehicles with dealer info
- **Beautiful UI** - Tailwind CSS cards and visualizations

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After implementing all files:

- [ ] Start orchestrator: `cd orchestrator && npm run dev`
- [ ] Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- [ ] Navigate to trade-in valuation form
- [ ] Enter a common VIN (e.g., `KMHLM4DG9SU008928` or `WAUENAF45JA013729`)
- [ ] Wait 800ms for auto-decode to trigger
- [ ] Verify Market Valuation section appears
- [ ] Check wholesale and trade-in estimates are populated
- [ ] Scroll to see comparable listings table
- [ ] Try entering custom mileage to see price adjustments

---

## 📊 Pricing Calculation

The system uses this formula:

```
Market Average Price = Sum(all listing prices) / number of listings

Mileage Adjustment = (vehicle mileage - avg listing mileage) × $0.10

Adjusted Price = Market Average - Mileage Adjustment

Wholesale Estimate = Adjusted Price × 0.85 (15% markup)
Trade-In Estimate = Adjusted Price × 0.80 (20% markup)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "autodev_api_key_missing" | Check `AUTODEV_API_KEY` in `.env.local` |
| "no_listings_found" | Vehicle too rare/new. Try common vehicle (2020 Chevrolet Silverado) |
| Pricing component not showing | Check imports in ValuationForm.tsx |
| Empty pricing data | Verify API key is valid and listings endpoint is running |
| 404 on /api/listings | Verify app.ts has `app.use('/api/listings', listingsRoutes);` |
